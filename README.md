# MERN-Stack-Implementation-AWS
In this project, I implement a web solution based on MERN stack in AWS Cloud.

## MERN Web stack consists of following components:

- MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.

- ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js.

- ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.


To perform this project, I must carry out the following steps
- Create a EC2 Instance
- Install the NGINX Web Server
- Install MYSQL
- Install PHP
- Configure NGINX to use PHP processor
- Test PHP with NGINX
- Retrieve data from MYSQL database with PHP
